# BMI
An analysis of the validity of BMI as a measure of body fat using NHANES data sets

## Background
This is a data analysis project I undertook in order to compare BMI to more detailed body composition measurements taken via DXA. DXA stands for dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry and is considered a gold standard tool for measuring body composition. Compare this to BMI (body mass index), which is simply calculated as weight over height squared, 
and you can see how there might be important discrepancies between the two. Notable, BMI does not distinguish between types of body tissue; fat, muscle, organs, bone, it all counts the same. Yet BMI is generally how obesity is defined by the largest health organizations in the world, such as the CDC and the WHO.

The main advantage of BMI is its ease of use. It costs nothing is quickly calculated.
